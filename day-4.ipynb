    "# Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "The requests library allows your Python program to communicate with websites and APIs over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "It lets your code ask a server for data and receive a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plain Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write:\n",
    "\n",
    "response = requests.get(\"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/25\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending a request to that URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Waiting for the server to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing the server’s reply inside response.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s all it is — a structured way to communicate over HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Happens Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "requests.get(url)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sends an HTTP GET request.\n",
    "\n",
    "“GET” means: retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server processes your request.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server sends back:\n",
    "\n",
    "A status code (like 200 for success)\n",
    "\n",
    "The requested data (often in JSON format)\n",
    "\n",
    "You access the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "data = response.json()\n",
    "\n",
    ".json() converts the response into a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can work with it like normal Python data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimal Mental Model\n",
    "\n",
    "requests = a tool that lets Python fetch data from the internet using HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not scrape automatically.\n",
    "It does not transform the data automatically.\n",
    "It just handles the communication."
